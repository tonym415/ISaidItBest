	<h1>About this site</h1>
	<div class="center-content">
		<p>
			Welcome to <b><i>Isaiditbest.com</i></b> . We are the premier debating website that lets you compete with other users to debate questions and news items in many different categories. Unlike, say, the rest of the internet, where you have no idea if you won an online argument or not, every debate ends with a decided winner!
		</p><br>
		<p>
			That sounds great. What do I get?
		</p><br>
		<p>
			In addition to the satisfaction of knowing you won an argument, if you compete for money, you have the opportunity to win money when you debate! We have games where each contestant can enter money, with the person who wins the argument winning the money. Even better, after winning an argument, you get to brag to all your friends on Facebook and other social media websites. Winners can display their winning argument to the question directly to social media. Let your friends know how much better you are than them at arguing.
		</p><br>
		<h3> How does playing for money work?</h3>
		<p>
			In addition to knowing that they won the argument, many people want the ability to win some money. This raises the stakes and makes the debating even more fun. Purchase credits from your user account page. Then, when selecting a game type, select one of the ones with an entry fee. When you win the debate, you get all of the credits minus five percent. All credits are redeemable for money at any time of your choosing.
		</p><br>
		<h3>How do I let everybody know that I won?</h3>
		<p>
			Whoever wins the debate can post the debate to Facebook and other social media websites. This post will display the question, all of the arguments by users, an official declaration of the winner, and the amount of money they won. It is optional to post this.
		</p><br>
		<h3> What categories for debates do you offer?</h3>
		<p>
			Isaiditbest.com offers several different categories. We offer:
			<br><br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Sports
					<ul>
						<li>NFL Football</li>
						<li>Baseball</li>
						<li>NCAA Football</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Politics
					<ul>
						<li>Political issues for conservatives</li>
						<li>Political issues for liberals</li>
						<li>Discussion of Politicians for conservatives</li>
						<li>Discussion of Politicians for liberals</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Movies and movie stars</li>
						<li>Bands and music</li>
						<li>TV shows</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			While you are free to choose any category, we do recommend that you pick a category for political issues with the political beliefs that best aligns with yours. There will still be plenty of disagreement even for people who have similar views, but this helps make sure that you aren’t outvoted simply because everyone else is opposed to all of your beliefs.
		</p>
		<h3>Are there rankings?</h3>
		<p>
			Yes. We have a system of ten different rankings. This let’s you know what a user has done previously. It also gives you a chance to show how great at arguing you are in comparison to everyone else. We use a proprietary algorithm to create our ranking system.
		</p><br>
		<p>
          (Title or subtitle)  Rankings Explained
		</p><br>
		<p>
			We have ten levels. We apply a combination of wins, winning percentage, and style points to determine users ranking.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			The following rankings go from lowest to highest. The rankings let people know where they stand.
